## Data2Semantics

Data2Semantics studies and develops essential semantic infrastructure for bringing [e-Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Science) to the next level.
	
A core task for scientific publishers is to speed up [scientific progress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_progress) by improving the availability of [scientific knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). This holds both for dissemination of results through traditional publications, as well as through the publication of [scientific data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data). The Data2Semantics project focuses on a key problem for data management in e-Science:

<div class="alert alert-info"><em>How to <strong>share</strong>, <strong>publish</strong>, <strong>access</strong>, <strong>analyse</strong>, <strong>interpret </strong>and<strong> reuse</strong> data?</em></div>

Data2Semantics is a collaboration between the [VU University Amsterdam](http://www.vu.nl/), the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl), [Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)](http://www.dans.knaw.nl/) of the [KNAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences), [Elsevier Publishing](http://www.elsevier.com) and [Philips](http://www.philips.com), and is funded under the [COMMIT](http://www.commit-nl.nl) programme of the [NL Agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation](http://www.agentschapnl.nl/en).
